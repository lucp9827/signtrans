Description: signtrans computes two types of transformations (S and R-sign) of the read counts, which are used as outcome variable in logistic regression models (S-sign) and probabilistic index models (R-sign). These methods can be used to test for differential abundance between groups marginally or conditionally, depending on the research question.
