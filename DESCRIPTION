Description: Simple sign and rank-based transformations (S- and R-sign) of the read counts of microbiome data, which are used as outcome variable in logistic regression models (S-sign) and probabilistic index models (R-sign). These models can be used to test for differential abundance between groups in a marginal or conditional setting, depending on the research question.
